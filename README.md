# Algorithms-Sedgewick
just working through an old book that i found

## 1.1 Basic Programming Model
This chapter is laying down the definitions and context for future work. Everything's written from a Java perspective. It goes into structure of a program, primitives, types of statements, inputs/outputs, and methods quite extensively.
